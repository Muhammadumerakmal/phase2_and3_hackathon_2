# Step 12: Create Frontend AddTodo Component

**Action:** Create `frontend/todo_ui/app/components/AddTodo.tsx` - a form component for adding new todos.

**Reasoning:** The AddTodo component provides an intuitive interface for task creation with enhanced UX features like focus states, loading indicators, and smart suggestions.

**Implementation Details:**
- Text input with icon and floating label effect
- Submit button with gradient styling and loading state
- Focus state with glowing border effect
- Quick suggestion buttons (Review code, Team meeting, Write docs)
- Loading spinner during submission
- Disabled state handling
