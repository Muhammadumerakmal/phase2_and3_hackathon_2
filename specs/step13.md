# Step 13: Create Frontend StatsCards Component

**Action:** Create `frontend/todo_ui/app/components/StatsCards.tsx` - a dashboard component displaying task statistics.

**Reasoning:** The StatsCards component provides visual feedback on productivity through animated counters, showing total tasks, completed tasks, in-progress tasks, and completion rate percentage.

**Implementation Details:**
- Four stat cards: Total Tasks, Completed, In Progress, Completion Rate
- Animated counter effect on mount
- Gradient backgrounds and icons for each stat type
- Percentage progress bar for completion rate
- Hover effects with shine animation
- Responsive grid layout (1-4 columns)
