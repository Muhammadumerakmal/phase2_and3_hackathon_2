# Step 19: Create Frontend Additional Pages

**Action:** Create placeholder pages for Calendar, Analytics, and Settings at their respective routes.

**Reasoning:** These pages complete the navigation structure defined in the Sidebar, providing a full application shell even if features are not yet fully implemented.

**Implementation Details:**
- `app/calendar/page.tsx`: Calendar view placeholder
- `app/analytics/page.tsx`: Analytics dashboard placeholder
- `app/settings/page.tsx`: User settings placeholder
- All pages protected and require authentication
- Consistent layout with sidebar navigation
