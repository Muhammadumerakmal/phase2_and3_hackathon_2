# Step 15: Create Frontend Login Page

**Action:** Create `frontend/todo_ui/app/auth/login/page.tsx` - the user login interface.

**Reasoning:** The login page provides secure authentication with a polished user experience, including loading states, error handling, and seamless navigation to registration.

**Implementation Details:**
- Username and password input fields with icons
- Form validation and error display
- Loading state with spinner animation
- JWT token storage in localStorage on success
- Redirect to dashboard after successful login
- Link to registration page
- TaskFlow branding with gradient effects
- Background decorations with blur effects
