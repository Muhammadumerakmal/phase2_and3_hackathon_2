# Step 18: Create Frontend Tasks Page

**Action:** Create `frontend/todo_ui/app/tasks/page.tsx` - dedicated page for viewing all tasks.

**Reasoning:** A dedicated tasks page provides users with a focused view of their todos, separate from the dashboard's overview layout.

**Implementation Details:**
- All Tasks view with filtering capabilities
- Integration with existing TodoList component
- Protected route requiring authentication
- Consistent layout with sidebar navigation
